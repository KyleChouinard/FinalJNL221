				<p class="byline"><i>By Kyle Chouinard<br>Asst. News Editor</i><br><hr></p>
				<p>Following the results of Syracuse’s 2021 election cycle, every Common Council seat is now filled by Democrats. Though incumbent mayor Ben Walsh out fundraised Democratic opponent Khalid Bey in individual donors on his road to win the election.</p>

				<p>Professor Mark Brockway, a faculty fellow in religion and political science at Syracuse University, called the city’s political landscape unique.</p>

				<p>He said this comes from the type of voters within the city</p>

				<p>“Syracuse has a very particular type of Democrat that votes,” Brockway said. “Fairly well off, educated -- kind of middle-y or upper-y class.”</p>

				<p>Brockway said that these voters tend to care about business, education, and making the downtown visibly cleaner. On Walsh’s now delisted 2021 campaign platform, Walsh highlights “Syracuse Surge,” which outlined over <a href=”https://www.syracuse.com/news/2019/01/walsh-outlines-syracuse-surge-the-biggest-economic-growth-plan-in-city-history.html”>$200 million</a> in economic spending.</p>

				<p>The platform also cited a 6% increase in the Syracuse Central School district’s graduation rate over Walsh’s tenure. Quality of life infrastructure such as roads and sidewalks were also included in the platform.</p>

				<p>Of the $51,037.13 in total individual donations in Syracuse during the election, $43,339.13 went to Walsh. Bey received $7,698 from individuals within Syracuse and Republican Candidate Janet Burman only received $100.</p>

				<p>Overall, $199,434.85 were pumped into the campaigns of Walsh, Bey and Burman. Just over a quarter of the funding for the campaign came from individual donors from Syracuse.</p>

				<p>Walsh’s massive lead in Syracuse individual donations reflected his domination on election day.</p>

				<p>Walsh gathered 60.7% of the vote, defeating Bey, who came in second. The gap between the two was over 33 points, according to <a href=”https://www.syracuse.com/politics/cny/2021/11/election-2021-voting-results-for-onondaga-county.html”>syracuse.com</a>.</p>

				<p>At the Common Council district level, Walsh’s large victories continued. In every single district, he outraised his opponents for individual donations by double-digit margins.</p>

				<p><h4>Focusing in on District Four</h4></p>

				<p>Bey previously served as the district 4’s Common Councilor from January 2014 to December 2015, according to an archived page of <a href=”http://web.archive.org/web/20140702144042/http://www.syrgov.net/Councilor_District_4.aspx”>syrgov.net</a>.</p>

				<p>Despite a “home field” advantage, District 4 was Bey’s worst performing district in individual donations. He only picked up 4% of the money given from individual donors in the area.</p>

				</script>


				<p>Adjunct Instructor in SU’s Maxwell School and a Former Director of Administration under Syracuse Mayor Tom Young Frank Lazarski said that the “power of incumbency” was at work in this campaign, pushing Walsh’s donations higher than his opponents.</p>

				<p>The power of incumbency does seem to make a difference, at least in the city of Syracuse. From data collected by <a href="https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2021/11/see-winner-of-every-syracuse-mayors-race-over-last-100-years.html">syracuse.com</a>, 58.3% of the last 12 mayoral election winners have been the incumbent.</p> 

				<p>Lee Alexander, a Democrat, won four mayoral elections in a row, the most of any Syracuse mayoral candidate in the last 100 years.</p>

				<p>“Mayor Walsh had a daily platform of ‘city news’ to present to the voters and did that well,” Lazarski said in an email statement to The Daily Orange. “Mayor Walsh also had extensive ties into the business community from his 3 ½ years as mayor.”</p>

				<p>Lazarski also highlighted that his strong ties to groups such as Centerstate CEO and the Syracuse community as a whole through his father and former mayor, Jim Walsh, propelled his ability to raise funds.</p>

				<p>Brockway echoed Lazarski’s reasoning, saying that Walsh’s family name likely aided him in his mayoral victory. </p>

				<p>Walsh not only collected more individual donations than Bey in District 4, he also had more unique donations than Bey. While Walsh had 33 unique individual donors in the district, Bey only had nine.</p>

				<p><h4>The Election and COVID-19</h4></p>

				<p>The 2021 Syracuse Mayoral Election had the unavoidable backdrop of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Of course, this altered the way the election was run.</p>

				<p>Lazarksi said that under normal circumstances, having enough funding to run a proper operation provides a significant advantage over your opponents. The pandemic, Lazarski said, made this advantage even more distinct.</p>

				<p>“Especially during this pandemic, the notion of a lesser funded candidate offsetting a lack of funding by going door-to-door was not a good option,” Lazarski wrote in an email statement. “So a candidate who had funding to do television advertising (the most expensive & effective) had a distinct advantage.”</p>

				<p>Brockway said that, during the pandemic, Walsh has kicked questions of COVID-19 guidelines such as mask mandates to the county level. Lazarski believes that, because of the impact COVID-19 has had on Syracuse, Walsh’s win should not be extrapolated to further elections.</p>

				<p>During the election, Walsh spent $144,919.10 on television advertising.</p>

				<p>“The city was in much better shape financially because of the American Rescue funds than it normally would have been,” he said. “So short term, Mayor Walsh succeeded in getting reelected but I’m not sure that long term the city of Syracuse will be able to grow and thrive on its own with significant help from Onondaga County, New York State and the Federal government.”</p>

				<p><h4>Fleeting Momentum for Khalid Bey</h4></p>

				<p>Brockway said the campaigns in Syracuse, compared to other elections, did not raise that much money. He said that the potentially un-competitive nature of the race, where many felt Walsh would have a run-away victory, could be why.</p>

				<p>“And you saw it in (the) 2020 (Presidential Campaign), the opposite way, right, in which the race is very competitive, sometimes it can lead to more money being injected into it,” he said.</p>

				<p>The lack of a felt competition can be seen in the rate of donations between Walsh and Bey.</p>

				<p>Throughout the final months of the election cycle, Ben Walsh brought in a consistent flow of campaign contributions from individual donors. The difference between his highest raising month -- from July to August -- was only 9%. Khalid Bey, though, had a 49% difference between his highest and lowest donated months within the same timeframe.</p>

				</script>

				<p>As the election approached, the amount of individual Syracuse donations coming to Bey decreased.</p>

				<p><h4>How Much Does Money Really Matter Though?</h4></p>

				<p>While Lazarski believes that funding can greatly influence an election, Brockway emphasized that money is not everything when it comes to running a good campaign. </p>

				<p>“I think the big lesson that I learned in 2020 is that we put way too much emphasis on donations and not enough emphasis on activism,” Brockway said.</p>

				<p>Brockway continued, saying that resources such as people-power, connections and effort can be just as influential as money flowing into a campaign. He said that, especially at the local level, these resources can be even more influential than money.</p>

				<p>“The people who want you to think that (money is everything) are the people who have the money,” he said.</p>
